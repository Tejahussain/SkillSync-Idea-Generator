## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Enter your skills** (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
2. **Select your available time** (10 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour).
3. **Choose the project type** (Fun, Creative, Resume-worthy, etc.).
4. Click **🎯 Suggest Idea** to get a smart, tailored project idea.
5. Use 🎤 **Voice Input** if you don't want to type.
6. Save your idea or copy it with one click.

All logic is built to **simulate GenAI behavior** — like generating outputs from your input prompt. This makes the app feel intelligent and interactive!
